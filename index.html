        <h2>My name is Pia.</h2>
        <p>I am a software developer and part-time teacher based in Linz 👩‍💻👩‍🏫. In my work I usually design and
          implement backend systems in Kotlin & Spring Boot and use several frontend technologies.</p>
        <p>I am active in the local programming club for children 🚸in Linz through which I found my passion for
          teaching others about things I am passionate about myself.</p>
        <p>Next to all things technology I am passionate about education, equality and the environment 🌏. Other than
          that I enjoy climbing, attending music festivals, reading, traveling (preferably alone) and drinking good beer
          🍺.</p>
